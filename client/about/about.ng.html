      <h1>About Cryptobot</h1>
      <p>Cryptobot is a project I put together in my spare time over a short vacation in Keystone, Colorado. Cryptobot currently uses <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">simulated annealing</a> to solve cryptograms to its best potential.</p>

      <h3>How Cryptobot Solves Cryptograms</h3>

      <p>
        Before Cryptobot tries to solve cryptograms, it reads Herman Melville's <i>Moby Dick</i>. It records the frequency of each letter in <i>Moby Dick</i> to get a frequency chart like this:
      </p>

      <div class="row text-center">
        <div class="col-xs-3 text-left" ng-repeat="item in aboutctrl.frequencyChart">
          {{item[0]}} : {{(item[1]*100) | number : 2}}%
        </div>
      </div>

      <br>
      <p>
        So the letter 'e' shows up 10.34% of the time. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now cryptobot makes another frequency chart but with <b>digrams</b>, which are two letter combinations. Cryptobot includes spaces as letters here because it's important to know which letters are commonly at the beginning and end of words. This chart is much larger (27^2), but here are some of the top most frequent digrams ('_' represents a space):  
      </p>

      <div class="row text-center">
        <div class="col-xs-3 text-left" ng-repeat="item in aboutctrl.digramChart">
          {{item[0]}} : {{(item[1]*100) | number : 2}}%
        </div>
      </div>

      <br>

      <p>
        Now that cryptobot knows a bit about <i>Moby Dick</i>, it takes a look at the cryptogram:
      </p>
      <p><pre>rtgmp srb fpdgkkgkd qx dpq ophy qghpw xe bgqqgkd fy nph bgbqph xk qnp frki, rkw xe nrogkd kxqngkd qx wx: xkmp xh qsgmp bnp nrw cppcpw gkqx qnp fxxi nph bgbqph srb hprwgkd, fzq gq nrw kx cgmqzhpb xh mxkophbrqgxkb gk gq, 'rkw snrq gb qnp zbp xe r fxxi,' qnxzdnq rtgmp 'sgqnxzq cgmqzhpb xh mxkophbrqgxkb?'  bx bnp srb mxkbgwphgkd gk nph xsk ugkw (rb sptt rb bnp mxztw, exh qnp nxq wry urwp nph eppt ophy btppcy rkw bqzcgw), snpqnph qnp ctprbzhp xe urigkd r wrgby-mnrgk sxztw fp sxhqn qnp qhxzftp xe dpqqgkd zc rkw cgmigkd qnp wrgbgpb, snpk bzwwpkty r sngqp hrffgq sgqn cgki pypb hrk mtxbp fy nph.  qnphp srb kxqngkd bx ophy hpurhirftp gk qnrq; kxh wgw rtgmp qngki gq bx ophy uzmn xzq xe qnp sry qx nprh qnp hrffgq bry qx gqbpte, 'xn wprh! xn wprh! g bnrtt fp trqp!'

      <p>
        First, Cryptobot makes the same frequency charts for the letters in the cryptogram. Cryptobot matches the frequency charts with each other to create its first guess at the cipher.
      </p>

      <h3>Frequency Chart for Single Letters in Cryptogram:</h3>
      <div class="row text-center">
        <div class="col-xs-3 text-left" ng-repeat="item in aboutctrl.puzzleFrequencyChart">
          {{item[0]}} : {{(item[1]*100) | number : 2}}%
        </div>
      </div>

      <br>

      <p>Since 'p' is the most common letter in the cryptogram, Cryptobot thinks it might be subsituting for the letter 'e', the most common letter in <i>Moby Dick</i>. 'q' is the second most common letter in the cryptogram, and 't' is the second most common letter in <i>Moby Dick</i>, so Cryptobot matches those two. It continues down the list for all 26 letters.</p>

      <br />

      <p>So the first guess isn't so hot, but how does Cryptobot measure whether its guess is good?!</p>
      <p>Cryptobot needs to score guesses to make sure they are improving. Cryptobot creates a score for a guess based on the sum of the absolute differences between digram freqencies in the guess and digram frequencies in <i>Moby Dick</i>. For example, the frequency of the digram 'e_' (where '_' represents a space) in the guess is 0.6%, whereas its frequency is 3.1% in <i>Moby Dick</i>. The absolute difference is 2.5%. Cryptobot adds these values up for all possible digrams and computes a score for the guess. This is called a 'cost function', and Cryptobot is trying to minimize the 'cost' of a guess.</p>
      
      <br />

      <p>Now comes the cool part. Cryptobot starts randomly swapping letters in the cipher and recalculating its cost function. The rules are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>set a <b>temperature schedule</b> -- the temperature is a score that gradually reduces as cryptobot iterates through new guesses. Cryptobot drops the temperature every 2000 guesses.</li>
        <li>Swap a set of letters in the cipher</li>
        <li>Calculate the cost function</li>
        <li>If the cost of the new guess is better than the old guess, Cryptobot accepts the new guess. If the cost of the new guess is the best guess yet, store this guess as the best guess.
        </li>
        <li>If the cost of the new guess is worse than the old guess, Cryptobot generates a random number between 0 and 1. If this number is less than e^((old_cost_function - new_cost_function)/temperature), cryptobot will accept the new guess anyway. Otherwise it will keep the old guess and ditch the new guess</li>
        <li>Keep guessing until the temperature is below a certain threshold</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This last two rules are what make Cryptobot awesome. If Cryptobot only accepted better guesses every time, it might find itself going down the wrong path without being able to backtrack. It would be like getting really far in a maze that takes you in the wrong direction. By enabling Cryptobot to accept slightly worse guesses, we give it some wiggle room to try new paths. Moreover, as the temperature drops, Cryptobot gets less and less wiggle room. Here's a sample of Cryptobot solving the cryptogram:</p>

      <h1>About Simon</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Simon. I'm a software engineer living in SF. I like making small projects like this to try new things and stay sharp. This site presented a bunch of fun little challenges. Simulated annealing turned out to be the easiest thing about this little app. The real challenge was baking Python code into Meteor via Node, having it stream data, and break nicely (yikes!). Even after that worked, Meteor's hosting won't run python scripts. So I built a Flask server on Heroku to run the simulated annealing and connected it to Meteor via DDP. But that didn't work in production either because Meteor's hosting has variable DDP connections! In the end, the version you're viewing doesn't even use Python, it uses Coffescript! There are always things to append and modify in any project, and I've decided this one is done enough to publish. Maybe I'll come back to it when I have a sec.</p>
